# Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing 
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:


Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan


That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
